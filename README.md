# flutter-test-driven-dev
My sandbox and intro to doing test-driven development with Flutter, using [Arnela Jasarevic's guide](https://medium.com/upday-devs/flutter-test-driven-development-e57f2defff43)

I'm doing this to familiarize myself with the TDD flow so that I can implement it into [Ugeddit](https://www.ugeddit.com)'s app and make our development, testing, debugging, and code management simpler, easier, and quicker.
