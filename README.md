# Test-Driven Development: Flutter
My sandbox and intro to doing test-driven development with Flutter, using [Arnela Jasarevic's guide](https://medium.com/upday-devs/flutter-test-driven-development-e57f2defff43)

As founder of [Ugeddit](https://www.ugeddit.com), I'm doing this to familiarize myself with the TDD flow so that I can implement it into our app to make our development, testing, debugging, and code management simpler, easier, and quicker.

Currently at [GREEN: Callback on pressed is correctly called](https://medium.com/upday-devs/flutter-test-driven-development-e57f2defff43#d9b0)... **Tutorial code is broken, here. See below...**
